# LFL Line Follower Project üöó

## Introduction

Welcome to the LFL Line Follower Project! This project was an exciting endeavor undertaken by our team, LFL, consisting of Dinu Andreea-Violeta, Marin Iulian and me, during our Robotics class. The goal was to design and build a line-following robot that could navigate a track with precision and speed. We combined engineering skills and creative problem-solving to construct a robot that not only meets the technical requirements but also showcases our innovative approach.

## Project Overview üåü

The LFL Line Follower is an intricately designed robot, guided by a QTR-8A Reflectance Sensor, enabling it to detect and follow a designated line. The heart of our robot is an Arduino UNO, which processes sensor data and controls the robot's movements through a PID controller. The PID controller is finely tuned to ensure optimal performance, balancing speed and precision.

## Key Components üõ†Ô∏è

- Arduino UNO (Central Processing Unit)
- QTR-8A Reflectance Sensor (For line tracking)
- L293D Motor Driver (Controlling DC Motors)
- 7.4V Li-Po Battery (Power source for motors)
- DC Motors (2) for movement
- Chassis (Custom-built from foam board)
- Ball Caster (For stability and smooth movement)
- Additional components: Medium Breadboard, Zip-ties, Wheels (2)

## Design and Construction üåà

Our team embarked on the challenging task of designing and constructing the chassis from a simple foam board. We mounted the motors and connected them to the L293D motor driver for independent wheel control. To further boost stability and maneuverability, we included a ball caster in our design. 

## Code and Control üìö

The robot's brain is programmed using a PID control strategy, with parameters meticulously adjusted through a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical testing. This ensures that our robot can adapt to different track conditions and maintain optimal line tracking.
